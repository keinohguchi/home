<TITLE>Linux Documentation Project Manifesto</TITLE>

<BODY>
This is the Linux Documentation Project ``Manifesto''<BR>
Last Revision 21 September 1998, by Michael K. Johnson
<P>
This file describes the goals and current status of the Linux Documentation 
Project, including names of projects, volunteers, FTP sites, and so on.

<H2>Overview</H2>
The Linux Documentation Project is working on developing good, 
reliable docs for the Linux operating system. The overall goal of the LDP is 
to collaborate in taking care of all of the issues of Linux documentation, 
ranging from online docs (man pages, texinfo docs, and so on) to printed 
manuals covering topics such as installing, using, and running Linux. The LDP 
is essentially a loose team of volunteers with little central organization; 
anyone who is interested in helping is welcome to join in the effort. We feel 
that working together and agreeing on the direction and scope of Linux 
documentation is the best way to go, to reduce problems with conflicting 
efforts---two people writing two books on the same aspect of Linux 
wastes someone's time along the way.
<P>
The LDP is set out to produce the canonical set of Linux online and
printed documentation. Because our docs will be freely available (like
software licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL) and distributed on
the net, we are able to easily update
the documentation to stay on top of the many changes in the Linux world.
If you are interested in publishing any of the LDP works, see the section 
``Publishing LDP Manuals'', below.

<H2>Getting Involved</H2>
Send mail to:
<A HREF="mailto:linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu">linux-howto@metalab.unc.edu</A>
<P>
Of course, you'll also need to get in touch with the coordinator
of whatever LDP projects you're interested in working on; see the next
section.

<H2>Current Projects</H2>
For a list of current projects, see the
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/ldp.html">LDP Homepage</A>.
The best way to get involved with one of these projects is
to pick up the current version of the manual and send revisions, editions,
or suggestions to the coordinator.  You probably want to coordinate with
the author before sending revisions so that you know you are working
together.


<H2>FTP sites for LDP works</H2>

LDP works can be found on sunsite.unc.edu in the directory 
/pub/Linux/docs. LDP manuals are found in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP, HOWTOs and
other documentation found in /pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO. 


<H2>Documentation Conventions</H2>
Here are the conventions that are currently used by LDP manuals. 
If you are interested in writing another manual using different conventions,
please let us know of your plans first.
<P>
The <b>man pages</b> -- the Unix standard for online manuals -- are created
with the Unix standard nroff man (or BSD mdoc) macros.
<P>
The <b>guides</b> -- full books produced by the LDP -- have historically
been done in LaTeX, as their primary goal has been to be <b>printed</b>
documentation.  However, guide authors have been moving towards SGML
with the DocBook DTD, because it allows them to create more different kinds
of output, both printed and on-line.  If you use LaTeX, we have a style
file you can use to keep your printed look consistent with other LDP
documents, and we suggest that you use it.
<p>
The <b>HOWTO</b> documents are all required to be in SGML format.
Currently, they use the <b>linuxdoc</b> DTD, which is quite simple.
There is a move afoot to switch to the DocBook DTD over time.
<P>
LDP documents must be freely redistributable without fees paid to the
authors.  It is not required that the text be modifiable, but it is
encouraged.  You can come up with your own license terms that satisfy
this constraint, or you can use a previously prepared license.  The
LDP provides a boilerplate license that you can use, some people like
to use the GPL, and others write their own.
<P>
The copyright for each manual should be in the name of the 
head writer or coordinator for the project. ``The Linux Documentation 
Project'' isn't a formal entity and shouldn't be used to copyright the docs.

<H2>Copyright and License</H2>
Here is a ``boilerplate'' license you may apply to your work.  It has
not been reviewed by a lawyer; feel free to have your own lawyer review
it (or your modification of it) for its applicability to your own
desires.  Remember that in order for your document to be part of the
LDP, you must allow unlimited reproduction and distribution without
fee.
<P>
This manual may be reproduced and distributed 
in whole or in part, without fee, subject to the following conditions:
<UL>
        <LI> The copyright notice above and this permission notice must be
          preserved complete on all complete or partial copies.

        <LI> Any translation or derived work must be approved by the
	author in writing before distribution.

        <LI> If you distribute this work in 
          part, instructions for obtaining the complete version of this 
          manual must be included, and a means for obtaining a complete 
          version provided.

        <LI> Small portions may be reproduced as illustrations for reviews or 
          quotes in other works without this permission notice if proper 
          citation is given.
</UL
<P>
Exceptions to these rules may be granted for academic purposes: Write
to the author and ask. These restrictions are here to protect us as 
authors, not to restrict you as learners and educators.
<P>
All source code in this document
is placed under the GNU General Public License, available via anonymous
FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/COPYING.

<H2>Publishing LDP Manuals</H2>
	If you're a publishing company interested in distributing any 
of the LDP manuals, read on.
<P>
By the license requirements given previously, anyone is allowed
to publish and distribute verbatim copies of the Linux Documentation Project
manuals. You don't need our explicit permission for this. However, if you
would like to distribute a translation or derivative work based on any of
the LDP manuals, you may need to obtain permission from the author, in writing,
before doing so, if the license requires that. 
<P>
You may, of course, sell the LDP manuals for profit. We encourage
you to do so. Keep in mind, however, that because the LDP manuals are
freely distributable, anyone may photocopy or distribute printed copies
free of charge, if they wish to do so. 
<P>
We do not require to be paid royalties for any profit earned from
selling LDP manuals. However, we would like to suggest that if you do 
sell LDP manuals for profit, that you either offer the author royalties,
or donate a portion of your earnings to the author, the LDP as a whole,
or to the Linux development community. You may also wish to send one or
more free copies of the LDP manuals that you are distributing to the authors.
Your show of support for the LDP and the Linux community will be very much
appreciated. 
<P>
We would like to be informed of any plans to publish or distribute
LDP manuals, just so we know how they're becoming available. If you are 
publishing or planning to publish any LDP manuals, please send mail to
ldp-l@linux.org.au.  It's nice to know who's doing what. 
<P>
We encourage Linux software distributors to distribute the LDP
manuals (such as the Installation and Getting Started Guide) with their
software. The LDP manuals are intended to be used as the "official" Linux
documentation, and we are glad to see mail-order distributors bundling 
the LDP manuals with the software. As the LDP manuals mature, hopefully
they will fulfill this goal more and more adequately.
